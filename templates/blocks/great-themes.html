    <p>From a full set of 207 original drawings for “The Book of Genesis” as re-told by Zap Comix artist R. Crumb, to a set of 23 interpretations of “Aesop’s Fables” by the great Jacob Lawrence, to Keith Haring’s obsessive rumination on “The Last Rainforest,” the collection reflects concerns of deep cultural significance.</p>
